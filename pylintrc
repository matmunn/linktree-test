# Justifications:
# no-member: Django model attributes (Pylint doesn't properly interpret fields)
# no-init: Meta classes on Django forms/models
# old-style-class: As above
# too-few-public-methods: As above
# too-many-ancestors: Django class based views
# too-many-instance-attributes: Bigger Django models
# locally-disabled, locally-enabled: Allow ignoring rules locally
# fixme: Useful to have
# ungrouped-imports: Necessary for aloe step discovery in some cases
# wrong-import-order: we are using isort for this
# signature-differs: Using **kwargs to capture all keyword arguments is valid
# unnecessary-pass: We need pass statements to make the code more readable
# C0330, C0326: black suggests these be disabled
# unsubscriptable-object: This is a calculated risk while running mypy.

# List of additional names supposed to be defined in builtins.
# When using django-split-settings, the settings are cascaded down so you
# don't have to redifine them again in the next component
# Pylint doesn't like this. So we tell Pylint that those names are built-ins
