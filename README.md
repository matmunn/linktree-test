# LinkTree Technical Test

## Database
For the sake of a tech demo project like this one I've chosen to run the default
SQLite database that Django ships with out of the box. If I was to build this into an
actual project I'd substitute it for a Postgres database.


## Third Party Apps
Considering the nature of this demo app I've chosen just to use the
`X-External-App` header to note that a "third-party app" is making the request.
**This is obviously insecure.**

If this were to be an app I would deploy as an actual product I would still make
use of the custom header, but also use the `Referer` header while making sure
that the URL provided matches a previously-supplied authorised URL, and make use
of an m2m token generated by whatever auth provider I happened to use for the
project.
